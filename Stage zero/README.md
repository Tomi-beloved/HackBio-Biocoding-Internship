In R programming, data structures are used and essential for storing, manipulating, and analyzing data. 
A data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified. 

# Common Data Structures are;

* List
* ‚Å†Vector
* Data frame 

# Why Data frame?

We chose a data frame because it organizes information into rows and columns, making it easy to manipulate and analyze.
Unlike lists or vectors, data frames are structured like tables, making it easier to analyzation and data visualization

**Data structure (Dataframe) in R was used to organize the following information of the team;**

- [Names]
- [Slack username]
- [Email]
- [Hobby]
- [Countries]
- [Discipline]
- [Preferred programming language]

Functions, loops, conditionals or any other complex concepts were not used in the organization at this early stages.
The code include a final print statement that prints the organized output in a logical and understandable way.

Our data came out neatly structured and well arranged.
